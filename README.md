# pysimulation
***Python Project***

This project serves as a simulation to estimate the population of prey, predators, and humans after a given amount of time.

In the code, you can edit the number of mammals on the island and the amount of time to be elapsed. --> This can be found in the main function.

The programs stores the entities of each mammal in classes and sub classes, mammals have the abilitiy to move to nearby locations on the island, and the humans, and predators have the ability to eat or kill.

The humans are denoted by H
The prey are denoted by O
and the predators are denoted by X

***Run Instructions***
1. Open the '.py' file in a python editor
2. Edit desired values
3. Run program

***Things I'd Like to Improve***
I'd Like to add a UI to this project. Rather than displaying the island as a grid, I'd like to display it as a photo of an island, and then denote the mammals by their respective photos.

I'd also like to give a better delivery of the project in terms of user friendliness.

It'd be ideal for those who dont use python to download a .exe that runs the program with UI for easy use.

I should add error exceptions in my program for values that are out of range to prevent the program from crashing.
